## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

### What I learned

Unnecessary nestings leave room for breakage and landmarks are important

### Continued development

I'm relatively still new to the whole responsiveness thing and chakra is fun to use but is a bit bulky. I want to know more about it tho.

### Useful resources

- [Chakra-UI for Beginers](https://www.chakrauiforbeginners.com/) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me finally understand chakra-ui. I'd recommend it to anyone new to this framework.
